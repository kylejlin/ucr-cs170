# CS170 Project 2 - Feature Selection

The "meat" of the project is in the `src/lib.rs` file.
The other files are mostly just helpers (e.g., IO functions) that are not very relevant to the actual search logic.
Specifically, most of the relevant logic is in either `forward_selection()`, `backward_elimination()`, or `leave_out_one_cross_validation()` (all of which are in `src/lib.rs`).
