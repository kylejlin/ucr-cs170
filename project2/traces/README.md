Since the credit card default dataset is much larger than the others, forward selection takes longer.
On my machine, it takes around 20 minutes.
Since I cannot requickly regenerate these results, I am saving a trace in this directory.

I am not including traces for the datasets used for the main part (i.e., the part that is _not_ extra credit) of this assignment, since I can generate those in under 20 seconds.
